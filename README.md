# Check Release for Tag

This GitHub Action checks whether a Git tag pushed to the repository has a corresponding GitHub Release.

## Purpose

- Ensure that every pushed tag is associated with a published release.
- Automate release validation as part of a CI/CD pipeline.
- Improve version management and traceability.

## Inputs

## Outputs
